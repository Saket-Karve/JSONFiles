The Year 2015 saw our Prime Minister undertake a whirlwind tour of 26 countries for bringing foreign investments to the country. Not only do we require foreign investments, but also their skill and technology. For that to happen our PM has worked hard and the people have co-operated effectively. The Make in India program was also launched by our PM in September 2014, devised to transform India into a global Design and Manufacturing hub.<br><br>In a short space of time, the obsolete and obstructive frameworks of the past have been dismantled and replaced with a transparent and user friendly system. The skill being acquired is used in the industrial zone and the waste generated from the industries should be dumped in the eco - friendly dumping zone, in support of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan campaign .The citizens are willing to pay foreign taxes so as to bring foreign investments into the country and the government of India has to look over the foreign exchange. Also the People will be notified about the progress taking place and the coverage can be spread only when India becomes fully digital. For this our PM has launched the Digital India campaign to ensure that government services are made available to citizens electronically by improving online infrastructure and by increasing internet connectivity. Finally, for real transformation to take place, both the PM and the citizens have to stick together and do their respective duties by taking oath in front of our National Flag. <br><br><a href = \"http://app.technovanza.org/vrc4.0.pdf\">Click Here</a> to download the gameplay",

Now the Government Robot takes the PM to foreign countries using track 1.<br><br> •  Meanwhile, the Citizens Robot adopt the scheme of acquiring skills under the <b>Skilled India</b> scheme to transform India.<br><br> •  Citizens Robot picks the skills acquired from the Development Zone (D.Z) and places it according to the priorities on the priority stage with the help of codes displayed under the PM.<br><br> •  Now the Citizens Robot which has acquired the skills is given new machinery to install in the Industry Zone (I.Z), under the <b>Make in India</b> scheme.<br><br> •  For the industry to get started, there is need to pay taxes, and bring the foreign skill. Therefore Citizens Robot rotates the disc to get the code disclosed and accordingly places one of the three taxes on the government bot near track 1 ending from the ramp and places the foreign skill on highest priority in priority stage. If any one of this task remains incomplete, industry won’t get started.<br><br> •  PM then brings the taxes by following track 2 and gives it to Citizens Robot to fill the track and Government bot will go to its starting point.<br><br> •  The PM then implements “Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan”.The Citizens Robot collects the waste materials from the industry zone to dispose it in the eco-friendly dumping-ground in the Dumping Yard Zone (D.Y.Z) <br><br>•  Government Robot follows the “Digital India” scheme on track 3 according to the code displayed under the foreign skill which tells whether the government bot has to start implementation of scheme by taking the first right or first left and complete track 3 and returns to the Government Robot Start Zone (G.R.Z) after implementing it.<br><br> •  Now the Citizens Robot places the Indian National Flag on the Government Robot and the Government Robot carries the PM and flag to the red Fort Zone (F.Z) by following track 4. <br><br>•  Then the Citizens Robot joins the PM for flag hoisting. Citizens Robot picks the flag and places the flag on red fort zone. <br><br><b>TASK COMPLETED</b><br><br><b>CODES:<br><br> 1.
